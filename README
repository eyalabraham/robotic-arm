    motor:
        TEAC 14769070-60, unipolar motor, 73ohm per winding (center tap to pole)
         One-Phase On: with no load, current draw approximately 340mA turning and 410mA hold, supply voltage 7.5v
         Two-Phase On: with no load, current draw approximately 260mA turning and 410mA hold, supply voltage 7.5v

         yellow - b1
         red    - b0
         blue   - b3
         white  - b2
    motor:
        FUJI SM55-4801, unipolar motor, 35ohm per winding (center tap to pole)
         One-Phase On: with no load, current draw approximately 610mA turning and 770mA hold, supply voltage 7.5v
         Two-Phase On: with no load, current draw approximately 450mA turning and 770mA hold, supply voltage 7.5v

         orange - b0
         black  - b3
         yellow - b2
        could not run at more that 400Hz, left code at 50Hz
        motor power supply: 7.5v / 1A   *** 1.2vpp ripple ***
        better motor power supply: 12.0v / 2A, switching power supply
    discussion:
                            servo Futaba s3003          vs.         stepper 14769070-60
            Stall Torque (4.8V): 44 oz/in. (3.2kg.cm)           0.5Kg.cm
                         (6.0V): 56.8 oz/in. (4.1kg.cm)
            Current      (4.8V): 7.2mA/idle                     (7.5v) 260mA
                         (6.0V): 8mA/idle
